//Decision Control Statement: SWITCH
//The switch statement in C is a control statement used to execute one block of code among
many options based on the value of an expression. It provides a way to simplify multiple
if-else conditions into a cleaner and more readable format when you have to choose between
many possible values for a variable.
Syntax:

switch (expression) {

case value1:

// Code to execute if expression == value1

break; // Exits the switch block

case value2:

// Code to execute if expression == value2

break; // Exits the switch block

// More cases as needed

default:

// Code to execute if expression doesn't match any case

break; // Exits the switch block
