Decision Control Statement: ‘else-if’ Ladder

The else-if ladder is used when there are multiple conditions to be checked. The program
evaluates each condition in sequence. If a condition is true, the corresponding code block is
executed, and the rest of the ladder is skipped..

Syntax:

if (condition1) {

// Code to be executed if condition1 is true

} else if (condition2) {

// Code to be executed if condition2 is true

} else if (condition3) {

// Code to be executed if condition3 is true

} else {

// Code to be executed if none of the above conditions are
true

}
